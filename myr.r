#This is a .R file, Comments should be light gray, ASCII characters !@#$%^&*()_+-=,./<>? OK!
#TODO: FIXME: NOTE: BUG: These capital words after an R comment should be white and eye catchy
#This wordasdf is misspelled and should be red background.  sentences should start with capital, blue background if not
#a rare word adscititious is technically correct but so rare it's highlighted this way
#lines should never have superfluous spaces at the end like this one       
θ
# non ASCII in comment or code, red background: θ
#example of rare word is here boolean, marked lighter grey background.  You know this is an inventor, 
#like Gauss for Gaussian.
