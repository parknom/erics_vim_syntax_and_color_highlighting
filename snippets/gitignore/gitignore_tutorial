#GIT sees every file in your working copy as one of three things:                                                              
#1.  Tracked - a file which has been previously staged or committed
#2.  untracked - a file which has not been staged or committed
#3.  ignored - a file which git has been told to ignore

#lines in the .gitignore file specify a regular expression pattern saying
#which files to ignore. 

#a blank line is no operation, whitespace at the end of lines is ignored
#unless the whitespace is quoted with a backslash like \   (aka backslash space)

#double asterisk means anywhere in the repository, single asterisk is
#wildcard for that filename

#A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in 
#front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.





#A word with a slash after is regarded as 'ignore this directory and its files 
#and subdirectories' anywhere it may appear in the repository.  Any files
#named 'target' are unaffected by this pattern.

build/            #ignore build directory and everything beneath
initial/target/   #ignore the directory target under directory initial


#slashes before a word enforce top most directory

/coredump.log      #ignore the file coredump.log in repo root


#A single asterisk matches zero or more characters in the filename.  This ignores any
#file anywhere in the repository ending in .class   notice periods are literal to their character
*.class
*.jar
*.pdf


#an exclamation point negates a pattern creating an exception (files not to ignore)
#the above patterns say don't track anything ending in .class, the blow says: "except for this one"
!importantclass.class


#double asterisk matches zero or more directories, at the beginning like '**/logs' it is superfluous 
#with 'logs/'.  slash word matches any directory in the repository named logs and everything underneath
**/logs
logs/**/debug.log         #any file named 'debug.log' anywhere underneath a directory named logs



#square brackets are a regex range meaning any single character matches.
#this matches debuga.log through debugc.log, but not debugd.log
debug[a-c].log


#wildcards can be used in directories.  Under the directory logs found anywhere in the
#repository, match the file called debug.log that's under any directory 'whatever_day'
logs/*day/debug.log    


#Secrets should be ignored (brittle hiding)
secrets.txt


#IDE's often take little shits on the repo by plunking .project files there.  
.project
.idea


# any file starting with hs_err
hs_err*

#Not sure what this is doing, I think dollarsign is literal, literal dollarsign and 0?  I don't get it
${0}

#Not sure what questionmark means since they don't look behind?  Weird
*.sw?
