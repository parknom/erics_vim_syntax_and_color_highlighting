    Lay it, lay it down, let me see your hand
    Show me what you got
    You're always talking, but you're not playing
    It doesn't match your face
    Gotta find my way, away from this place
    Can you take me now
    I-I want it, I want it real
    Are you afraid of me now?
    Are you afraid of me now?

    Do you feel it, do you feel it?
    Do you feel that I can see your soul?
    Do you feel it, do you feel it?
    Do you feel the beat in your heart?

    I-I want it, I want it real
    Run away with me now
    I-I want it, I want it real
    Run away with me now

    Someday's I'm built of metal, I can't be broken
    But not when I'm with you
    You love me real, we have it all
    Can't leave me now
    I love the way, you are today
    Run away with me now
    Wind in my hair, cause I don't care
    Baby run away with me now
    Run away with me now

    Do you feel it, do you feel it?
    Do you feel that I can see your soul?
    Do you feel it, do you feel it?
    Do you feel the beat in your heart?

    I-I want it, I want it real
    Run away with me now
    I-I want it, I want it real
    Run away with me now

    Drinking in the summer, I'm good at running
    I beat you in the race again
    Are you afraid, when I look your way
    It's easiest to stay at home
    But then we taste it, we got to have it
    We have no control
    Where is the love, the kind we dream of
    The kind that makes us young
    The kind that makes us young

    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out
    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out
    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out
    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out
    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out
    Don't leave me
    Never leave me out


Billions of machine learning algorithms on computers shouting at each over the internet will be like the synapse and mylin sheath in your head right now, as you read this sentence, each computer will simultaneously rely on and undergird each other and lifting each other up like the rising tide, any single computer will be like a neuron, useless by itself, but as part of a fleet of billions of others, a super intelligence orders of magnitude greater than any team of minds may emerge like a child discovers its own existence.

It's first major thought and behavior may be the same ones we see from higher mammals or humans when they first discover their own existence: "Woah this is cool, ooh look at the shiny thing, lets smash it".
